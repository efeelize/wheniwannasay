How_i_learn_best

My verison

1)it is depends on what u r trying to learn

reading and explaining to others can only give u conceptual understanding. when it comes to sth that is ultimately not abstract, the best way would 2 b able 2 make sth(ie.practice it!)after learning the fundamental concepts

2)to learn faster ,avoid becoming trapped in closed loops of self reinforcing hidden assumptions,then learning can expand unobustructed between domains and across paradigm shifts,hence it will progress faster and more smoothly.

3)enquiry into any/al assumptions .i do not mean a purely intellectual enquiry,i mean focusing attention upon these activities within the mind as they occur,apprehending them within awareness and understanding them through insight.
 
 only when al habitual thought processes and their consequent assumptions have been overcome can the mind perceive clearly.then every moment of awarness nurtures the growing light of understanding ,thus every exercise is a lesson .

 4)haha, i always trap myself with "i will bookmark this 4 when i need it"
really,easy to say,easy to understand,fucking hard to execute.
