# PRINCIPLES for LEGAL DRAFTING
### 1)incl:
- all the various types of documents that set forth rights,duties,and liabilities in the future.
- contracts,wills,trusts,municipal ordinances,rules,regualtions,statutes

### 2)request
- unmistakable--people will read it adversarially
- a committee product
- boring to read
- easy to consult?
- deals with future events.

## 31. draft for  an ordinary reader,not 4 a mythical judge who might someday review the document.

### 1.cuz
- 1)lawyers who draft for judges tend to adopt a highly legalistic style,since judges have legal training,yet becuz these lawyers aren't litigators,they almost never interact with judges.they don't know how much most judges detest legalese.

- 2)judges never see most drafted documents-only a small fraction of 1% ever get litigated.

- 3)this apporach contemplates only the disaster that might occur if litigation were to erupt.it does nothing to prevent the litigation from arising.in other words,the approach focuses exclusively on the back-end users,with no concern for the front-end users who must administer and abide by the document.

- 4)the further removed a document is from plain english,the more likely the parties are to ignore it in their everyday dealings.it won't effectively govern their relationship.

- 5)the further removed a document from plain english,the more divergent the views will be about its meaning--even among judges.

### 2.avoid
- drafters often lapse into the poor habit of addressing their provisions directly to someone other than the reader for whom the document is ostensibly written.

### 3.notes
- write for ur immdiate readers--the ones to whom u're directing ur communications.don't write for some remote decision maker who probably won't ever see,let alone interpret,the document.if u write well for the front-end users,u're less likelt to have trouble down the line.

## 32.organize provisons in order of descending importance.
###1.cuz
- remember that plain english is concerned with readers--what they need to know and when they need to know it.u can't be content to let readers fend for themselves.u'll need to organize document so logially and clearly that further reference to any specific point is easy.although the nature of the particular
document will influence the stru.

### 2.guidelines
- 2.1)put the more important before the less impor.
- 2.2)put the broadly applicable before the narrowly applicable.
- 2.3)put rules before exceptions.
- 2.4)try to make whatever u write--and every part within it--self-contained.ur readers shouln't have to remember other documents or sections,or flip back to them,to make sense of what u're saying.

### 3:eg:
#### contract
- 1st substantive provisions:the parties main obligations to each other
       
#### statue
- put the main requirements up front,everything else flows from them.


## 33.minimize definitions & cross -references, if u have more than just a few definitions,put them in
- schedule at the end , not at the beginning .
 
### 1.aviod 
- to have to definitions up front.this approach violate [32]these definitiions are nothing but a ruse,by and large,for stripping the important informations from the relevant provisions and sticking it somewhere else.for the purpose of willful obscurity.

### 2.way to reduce definitions
- 2.1 put all the definitions in a schedule at the end of ur document.call it Schedule A.
- 2.2 postpone until u achieve some degree of seniority--is to rewrite the document to cut the definition in half simply say that u mean at the very place where u're discussing sth.
- 2.3 have the definitions fewer than six.they're likely to be only the most important terms.

### 3.cross-reference
- 3.1 the question is that whether they are genuinely intend to help the reader.
- 3.2 a more readable version would incorporate the elements of the cross-referenced statute:u don't need to hunt elsewhere. 
- For the purpose of this rule,a 'commercial action' is one in which(1)neither party is a natural person,(2)the dispute concerns a business transaction,or (3)the lawsuit involves a claim of subrogation,contribution, or indemnity.


## 34.break down enumerations into parallel provisions.put every list of subparts at the end of sentence--
never at the beginning or in the middle

### 1.way
#### 1.1 finding enumerated items 
#### 1.2 breaking them out into subparts
- 1.2.1 breaking down the list into paralle provisions,with cascading indents from the left margin,clarifiesthe provisons.

- like:Temination Fees Payable by Pantheon,
- (A)any of the following occurs (1)...(2)...
- (B)

#### 1.3 working to ensure that the passage remains readable
- 1.3.1 keep the subject and verb together toward the beginning of the sentence.
- 1.3.2 find the operative verb in the sentence and move it toward the front,putting ur lists at the end of the sentence.even with fairly modest lists,this technique can enhance readability.

### 2.notes
- 2.1 aviod 1-2-3 enumeration within a paragraph.it could be useful in ordinary expository writing.
- 2.2 use this technique almost everytime u see parenthesized romanettes((,ii,iii)or letters(a,b,c)in the middle of a contractual or legislative paragraph.


## 35.delete every shall




## 36.do not use provisos.





## 37.replace and||or wherever it appears





## 38.prefer the singualr over the plural





## 39.prefer numerals,not words,to denote amounts,avoid word-numeral doublets.





## 40.if u do not understand a form provision||do not understand why it should be included in ur document,try diligently gain that understanding,if u still can not understand it,cut it.
