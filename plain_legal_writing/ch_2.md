### 2)way
#### 2.1)delete a prepositional phrase as verbiage->streamling the sentence
- eg:the provisions of ;the terms of;conditions of ->subject to the 2010 legislation

#### 2.2)change an of-phrase to a possessive form
- eg:for the success of the co.->for the co.'s success

#### 2.3)replace a prepositional phrase with an adjective or adverb.
- eg:to the study of the history of California->to the study of California history

### 3)notes:
- if :keep of-phrase, delete the other one and use adjective
- same as -ion phrase(15)
- eg:advised him of the lack of ...->advised him that he had no...

### cuz: -ion wors is the long abstract way to say the short way uses a straightforward verb.
- eg:that is merely convenient for the effectuation of the co.'s purpose->that is merely covenient to effectuate the co.'s purpose.


## 16.aviod doublets & triplets
### 1)notes

## 17.refer 2 people & co. by name.
never use corresponding terms ending in -ee or -or

### cuz
it makes ur writing halfway dull & also suggests that u lower urself 2 transparently cheap tricks.

#### 1)preference 4 real names's LIMITS
- 1.1)briefly discussing a case other than the one u r currently  involved in.
- 1.2)when multiple parties r aligned in such a way that a single name is inaccurate.

#### 2) major drawbacks of -ee or -or
- 2.1) means u r diff the parites with nothing but a 2-character suffix:u r inviting typographical errors,misreadings and confusions.

- 2.2) u r making ur document look as if u coppied if from a formbook-and it is understandable that people will think u did just that.

- 2.3) u will review ur own work less attentively if u use these boring lables -and u r therefore more likely 2 make substantive mistakes.


## 18.donot habitually use parenthetical shorthand names.
- use them only when u really need them.
- if u tell the story competenly,any reader will know what order,what action,and what trial court u r talking about.

### only use parenthetical when:
#### 1)if u r going to refer to sth the acronym is well established.
    eg:signed originally in 1948, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade("GATT")promotes international trade by lowering import duties.

#### 2)if u r talking about a case with two or more entities having confusingly similar names,a shorthand reference will dispel the confusion.
  
    eg:Seattle Credit Corporation ("Seattle Credit")has sued Seattle Credit Enginering Corporation("SC Engineering")for trademark infringement.


## 19.shun newfangled acronyms
- 1)The acronyms are shoutcuts,all right--but 4 themselves,not for their readers.
   
- 2)refuse 2 engage in that type of self-important obscurity.

- 3)u might writw it up as a good journalist would,give the reader credit 4 having read the title that shows the full name of sth.

## 20.make everything u write speakable
