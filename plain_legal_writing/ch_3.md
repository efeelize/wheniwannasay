# PRINCIPLES FOR ANALYTICAL & PERSUASIVE WRITING

## which incl
- MEMO
- LETTER
- BRIEFS
- JUDICIAL OPINION and the like

## major goals
- get ur point across quickly with a concrete summary up front
- focus the analysis argument
- make it interesting
- supply smooth transitions
- quote smartly and deftly   

## 21.plan all 3 parts
### 1)the beginning->an introduction
#### 1.1)avoid:restate the title
hence+title sentence

#### 1.2) ideal
- 1) places the essential ideas before the reader
- 2)always put a preliminary statement on the first page of a brief,even if the rules do not call for it.
- 3)don not spend on a rule to tell u to put the issues up front.
- 4)always add a preliminary statement that highlights the issues.

#### 1.3) Q:how to decide what goes into an introduction?
- 1st figure out how many arguments u want to make
- 2nd turn each one into an issue statement.

### 2)the middle->a main body
#### 2.1)aviod
#### 2.2)ideal
- 1)with a series of headlings and perhaps subheadlings
- 2)develop the rasoning by which the writer seeks to prove the affirmative or the negative of the issues stated in the introduction.

> Q:HOW?

>A:1st select the main ideas that prove u conclusion 2nd arrange them in a way that shows the relations they naturally bear to one another & to the essential ideas.

- 3)each part will be organized to do 4 th.set forth the legal rule  embedded in the issue statement.show how the factual points fit into this rule deal with the counterarguments(most tricky) USE thesis-antithesis-conclusiondrive the point home with an additional reason or set of reasons

### 3)the end->the conclusion
#### 3.1)avoid:for all the foregoing reasons...
wherefore,premises considered...
                 
#### 3.2)ideal:briefly sum up the argument
answer the questions posed in the opener recapitulate ur main points concisely & perhaps put them in a nutshell.


## 22.use the "deep issue" 2 spill the beans on the 1st page.
### 1)content:
- the question
- the answer
- the reasons

### 2)ideal
work on a complicated case for months or even years but be able to distill its essence down to a page 
 
### 3)benefits
- 3.1)testing the validity those conclusions more thorougly
- 3.2)ensuring that u carry thorough with them when u get to the middle
- 3.3)eliminating slag that ur reasearch has produced but that doesn't help the analysis.

### 4)HOW
- put the issue first never begin with whether or any other interrogative word break each issue into a separate sentences
- keep each issue to 75 or fewer words.
- weave in enough facts & arrange them chronologically,to show how the problem arises.
- forget about whether the answer is yes or no

### 5)DIFF memo & brief
#### 5.1)memo
 u don't know the answer when u read the Q,the A ,ie,underlying legal rule,should immediately folow an analytical issue.

#### 5.2)brief
- the Q should suggest the answer u want.
- USE syllogism: 
- legal rule\major premise
- factual premise\minor premise preferably in chronological order
- short & punchy Q\the conclusion expressed interrogatively

## 23.summarize ,do not overparticularize
### 1）USE
when state the fact of the case,u need to be sure that u first give an introductory summary

### 2)HOW
- omit the tedious details

- test:if it is not necessary to understanding the issue || does not add human interest;leave it out.

### 3)aviod:precise dates 
- use :the next day\during the next nine months\three months later\


## 24.introduce each paragraph with a topic sentence.
### 1)USE
- discuss case law

### 2)TIPS:use citation & footnoted to fix the disruption of chronology
delay the citation enables u to write a stronger topic sentence.

## 25.bridge between paragraphs
- 1)pointing words: that is, this,these,those,the
- 2)echo links:ie,words or phrases in which a previously mentioned idea reverberates.
- 3)explicit connectives:

 | when               |              use       |
 | ----------------- | -----------------------  |
 | adding a point      |   nor,along with,also,further,in addition,besides,what is more,similarly,likewise,moreover |
 | giving an example  |  as one example,to cite but one example,for one thing,for another thing.likewise,another,for instance |
 | contrasting  |               yet,instead,however,still,nevertheless,nonetheless,conversely,on the contrary whereas,in contrast to,unfortunately | 
| restating  | this means,insimpler terms,in short,put differently,again,that is,in other words. |
| comparing   |    in the same way,similarly,likewise |
introducing a cause              since ,when,becuz
| introducing a result  |  hence,as a resuly,therefore,accordingly,then ,so |
| conceding || qualifying   | granated,of course,to be sure, admittedly,though,even though,even if,only if,true,while,naturally,in some cases,occasionally,if,while it might be argued that,despite |
| pressing a point     |   assuredly,still,even so,in fact,as a matter of fact,indeed,of course,still.without exception,even so,anyway,the fact remains,assuredly. |
| explanning a sentence   |  that is,then ,earlier,previously,meanwhile,simulataneously,now,immediately,at once,until now,soon,no sonner,that being so,afterwars,later,eventually,in the future,at last,finally,in the end. | 
| summing up  |   to summarize,to sum up,to conclude,in conclusion,in short,in brief,so ,and so,concequently,therefore,all in all |
| sequencing ideas    |   first ,second,third,finally |

## 26.vary the length of ur paragraphs,but generally keep them short.
- 1)strive for an average paragraph of no more than 150 words--preferably fewer--in 3 || 8 sentences.
- 2) there is nothing wrong with one sentence paragraph.

## 27.provide signposts along the way
### 1）good signposts are especially improtant when the writing is double-spaced .
### 2) when:
at the bottom of page one:the examiner's reasoning was flawed--followed by a long paragraph intro by the words  "in the first place"

##### two ways:2.1) the better one :
 the examiner's reasoning was flawed for three reasons--followed by a bulleted list[43] succinctly introducing those reasons before u embark on a full explanation
####  2.2) omit the bulleted list while metioning that there are 3 reasons.

## 28.unclutter the text by moving citation into footnotes.
- 1)only put citation in footnotes.
- 2)the only argument against footnoting citation is the odd accussation that doing so diminishes the importance of the precedent,which not.

## 29.weave quotations deftly into ur narrative.

### Q:what r u to do?
- 1st tailor the lead-in to the quotation.say sth specific,assert sth.
- 2nd let the quotation support what u have said.

### GOOD LEAD-INS
- 1)the statue specifies three conditions that a trustee must satisfy to be fully indemnified.

- 2)becuz the plaintiff had not proved damages beyond those for breach of contract,the court held that the tort claim should have been dismissed.

- 3)in facts,as the court noted,not all written contacts have to be signed by both parties.

- 4)the CENTRAL AIRLINES court recognized that the facts before it involved a lawyer who neither willfully nor neligently misled the opposing party.

- 5)the power to zone is a state power that has been satatutorily delegated to the cites.

- 6)the court found that **'s exports laws are stricer than its in-state regualtions.


## 30.be forthright dealing with counterarguments.
### 1) case_the impeachment proceeding of 1998-99 position:Clinton:
- 1)concede that the president's conduct was anything but exemplary.
- 2)it didn't rise to the level of an impeachment offense.

### position:Kenneth Starr
- 1)concede that the constitutional threshold(high crimes and misdemeanors) requires significant wrongdoing and that distasteful behavior in itself would not be enough.
- 2)perjury and obstruction of justice-even if subject is as personal as sex-did meet the threshold.

### 2)NOTES
- 1)do not set out ur opponent's points at great length before supplying an answer.

- 2)try addressing the counterargument in the middle part of each argument--not at the beginning and not at the end.--the knock each one downs. 

- 3)stru:
- legal premise->factual premise->conclusion->possible objection->answer to objection->another possible objection->answer to objection->further point in support->clincher
